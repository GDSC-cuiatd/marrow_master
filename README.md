**Marrow Master: Experience the future of cell classification on your device**

Marrow Master revolutionizes bone marrow cell classification using machine learning. With a diverse dataset, our model offers quick and accurate analysis accessible via a user-friendly Flutter mobile app.

## Problem Statement

<br/>
<blockquote align='center'>
<h3>‚Äú6 out of 10 people suffer from blood cancer.‚Äù</h3>
</blockquote>
<br/>

With the rising prevalence of blood cancer among ageing populations, patients face debilitating symptoms like fatigue and weakness, leading to frequent hospital visits and emotional distress. This creates significant challenges for both patients and caregivers, emphasizing the urgent need for improved management strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è &nbsp;Key Functionalities

![Key Functionalities](assets/key-functionalities.jpg)

### Clinical Diagnostics Assistance:
This application focuses on aiding hematologists and pathologists in accurately classifying bone marrow cells for the diagnosis and monitoring of various blood diseases, including leukemia, anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and others. Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal increase in white blood cells. Anemia is a condition in which the body lacks enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues. Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells or a malfunction in the bone marrow.

By automating processes and decreasing diagnostic response time, the application enables healthcare practitioners to concentrate on complex patient care tasks.

### Research Support:
In addition to clinical use, this application supports research in haematology, stem cell biology, and related fields. Researchers can utilize it to study bone marrow samples for scientific investigations, medication development, and deeper understanding of hematopoiesis‚Äîthe process of blood cell formation. Accurate classification of bone marrow cells is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and monitoring patient development.

### Educational Tool:
This application serves as an educational tool for training new haematologists and pathologists. It provides expertise in bone marrow cell classification and helps users comprehend the complexities of different cell types. This feature contributes to the professional development of medical practitioners in the field.

User Authentication and Profile Management:
Users can register and log in to the system, accessing a personalized home screen upon login. They have the option to upload images from the gallery or camera, which are then sent to the server's model for analysis. Results, including cell name and description, are returned to the user's app and stored in Firebase for maintaining a history of analyses.

### Profile Management and Security:
Users can update their profiles and change passwords within the application, ensuring their information is up-to-date and secure. This feature enhances user experience and data protection.

This application streamlines the process of bone marrow analysis, supports medical research and education, and provides users with a secure platform for clinical diagnostics. It combines cutting-edge technology with user-friendly features to meet the needs of healthcare professionals, researchers, and educators in the field¬†of¬†hematologyClinical Diagnostics Assistance:
